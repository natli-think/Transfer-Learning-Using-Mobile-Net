# Transfer-Learning-Using-Mobile-Net
This is a DIY Project
The aim of this project is to get a hands-on experience on Transfer Learning Using Mobile Net of keras. Here we use Mobilenet to classify images of dogs. It subtly misclassifies an image of a blue tit. We then retrain Mobilenet and employ transfer learning such that it can correctly classify the same input image.
